Websocket Tools
===============

A lightweight cross-platform header-only library for websocket communication over a network.

* Websocket Tools allows the creation of websocket servers and clients either with civetweb or apple network tools.
* Data can then be sent between servers and clients via websockets.
* When creating servers and clients you can pass handlers for callbacks into your code.

Getting started:
---------------------------------
- Ensure that submodules have be initalised and updated to bring in civetweb
- Include include/websocket-tools.hpp (this includes all other required headers) 
- Use cw_ws_server/cw_ws_client for civetweb functionality or nw_ws_server/nw_ws_client for apple networking functionality
